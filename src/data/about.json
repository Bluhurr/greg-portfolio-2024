  "aboutText": "I've always enjoyed blending my creativity and coding abilities to create unique experiences on the web. Apart from at my laptop, you can either find me building out my Chevy van camper conversion, or enjoying nature while hiking or skateboarding. My whole life, I've always enjoyed playing video games and interactive 3D experiences, and now using React Three Fiber/Three.js I'm able to bring that interactivity to the web!",
